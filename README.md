# Lung-Disease-Classifier
Lung diseases such as COVID-19, viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, and tuberculosis pose significant global health challenges. Existing diagnostic methods can be time-consuming and lack accuracy, necessitating more efficient and precise diagnostic tools. This paper proposes a deep learning-based system leveraging the VGG16 model for automatic classification of various lung diseases from chest X-ray images, minimizing the need for constant human intervention. The system consists of three phases: data acquisition and preprocessing, model development, and web application deployment. A large dataset of labeled chest X-ray images across different lung disease classes is collected and preprocessed to train the deep learning model. The trained model extracts relevant features from input X-ray images to categorize them into corresponding disease classes.
